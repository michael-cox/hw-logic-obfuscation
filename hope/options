-s 500 -r 10 -F faults -l log -U undetected_faults

ran with 
./hope -c options c880.bench > s.out

faults will be in faults file
(if making file that already exists may need to delete)
-s for seed
-r for amount of random generations

if you want fixed test pattern
	replace -r 10 with -f fn
	where the file follows the format
		1: input
		2: input
		etc...
